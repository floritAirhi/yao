Fusion Team 2007 was a revolutionary product from Autodesk that enabled designers to work together on complex design projects across different locations and devices. Fusion Team 2007 allowed users to create, share and manage design data in a cloud-based platform that supported various file formats, including Fusion 360, CAD, PDF, Excel and images. Users could also view 2D and 3D designs in a browser, markup and comment on them, track project updates and access their data anywhere with an internet connection.
 
Fusion Team 2007 was one of the first examples of a **fusion team**, a multidisciplinary team that blends technology and business domain expertise and shares accountability for business and technology outcomes. Fusion teams are organized by the cross-cutting business capabilities, business outcomes or customer needs they aim to address, rather than by functions or technologies. Fusion teams are essential for successful digital transformation, as they can accelerate time to value and manage risk in digital business initiatives.

## How Fusion Team 2007 Changed the Way of Collaborating on Design Projects
 
Before Fusion Team 2007, designers had to rely on traditional methods of collaborating on design projects, such as emailing files back and forth, using FTP servers or shared drives, or meeting in person to review designs. These methods were inefficient, time-consuming and prone to errors and miscommunication. Designers also had to deal with compatibility issues between different software applications and file formats, as well as security and access control challenges.
