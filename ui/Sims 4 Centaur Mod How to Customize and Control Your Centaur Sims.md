# How to Turn Your Sims into Centaurs with Mods
 
If you love fantasy and mythology, you might have wondered how to create centaurs in The Sims 4. Centaurs are half-human, half-horse creatures that have appeared in many legends and stories. They are often depicted as wild, fierce, and loyal beings that live in harmony with nature.
 
Unfortunately, The Sims 4 does not have an official way to make centaurs in the game. However, thanks to some talented modders, you can download custom content that will allow you to transform your Sims into these mythical creatures. Here are some of the best mods and CC packs that will help you create your own centaur Sims.
