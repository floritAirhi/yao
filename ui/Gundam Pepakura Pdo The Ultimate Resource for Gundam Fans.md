# How to Make Your Own Gundam Papercraft with Pepakura
 
If you are a fan of Gundam, the Japanese military fiction media franchise that features giant robots or mecha[^3^], you might have wondered how to make your own Gundam model. One way to do that is by using Pepakura, a program that creates buildable papercraft models from 3D data[^2^]. In this article, we will show you how to use Pepakura to make your own Gundam papercraft with PDO files.
 
## What is Pepakura?
 
Pepakura (often referred to as "Pep") is a program that allows you to create papercraft models from 3D data. You can use Pepakura to import various 3D file formats, such as OBJ, STL, DXF, LWO, 3DS, etc., and then unfold them to a flat template that can be printed, cut, folded, and glued together. Pepakura also lets you edit the 3D model and the unfolded template, such as changing the scale, adding or deleting parts, adjusting the flaps, etc. Pepakura can save files in its native extension (.pdo), which can be opened by other Pepakura users. You can also export the template as an image file or a PDF file for printing.

## What is Gundam Pepakura PDO?
 
Gundam Pepakura PDO is a file that contains the 3D model and the unfolded template of a Gundam papercraft. You can find many Gundam Pepakura PDO files online, such as on Cosplay Archive[^1^], where you can download PDO files for various Gundam models from different anime series. You can also create your own Gundam Pepakura PDO file by using a 3D modeling software and importing it to Pepakura.
 
## How to Make Your Own Gundam Papercraft with Pepakura?
 
To make your own Gundam papercraft with Pepakura, you will need the following materials and tools:
 
- A computer with Pepakura installed. You can download Pepakura from [here](https://www.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/).
- A printer and paper. You can use any kind of paper, but thicker paper (such as cardstock) will make your model more sturdy.
- A pair of scissors or a hobby knife.
- Glue or tape.
- A Gundam Pepakura PDO file. You can download one from Cosplay Archive[^1^] or create your own.

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps:

1. Open the Gundam Pepakura PDO file with Pepakura. You will see the 3D model on the left and the unfolded template on the right.
2. If you want to edit the 3D model or the template, you can use the tools on the menu bar or the toolbar. For example, you can change the scale of the model, add or delete parts, adjust the flaps, etc.
3. When you are satisfied with the model and the template, you can print them out. You can choose to print them as one page or multiple pages, depending on the size of your model and paper. You can also choose to print them as an image file or a PDF file.
4. Cut out the template pieces along the solid lines. Be careful not to cut off the flaps or tabs that are used for gluing.
5. Fold the template pieces along the dotted lines. The mountain folds are indicated by dashed lines and the valley folds are indicated by dash-dot lines.
6. Glue or tape the template pieces together according to the numbers and symbols on the flaps and tabs. You can use the 3D model on Pepakura as a reference for how to assemble them.
7. Congratulations! You have made your own Gundam papercraft with Pepakura!
