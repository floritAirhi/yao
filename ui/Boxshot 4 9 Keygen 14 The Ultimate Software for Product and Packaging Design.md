- Choose a shape from the built-in library
- Load your artwork and adjust the settings
- Apply materials and effects
- Render and export your mockup

## Choose a shape from the built-in library
 
The first step is to choose a shape that matches your product or design. Boxshot 4.9.14 comes with over 70 shapes that you can use for your mockups. You can find them in the Shapes panel on the left side of the interface.
 
For this example, we will use the Book shape from the Books category. To add it to the scene, simply drag and drop it from the panel to the workspace. You can also double-click on it or use the Add button.
 
You can use the mouse or the toolbar buttons to rotate, move and zoom the camera around the shape. You can also use the Scene panel on the right side of the interface to select and manipulate the shape.
 
## Load your artwork and adjust the settings
 
The next step is to load your artwork and apply it to the shape. You can use any image file that you have on your computer or online. Boxshot 4.9.14 supports JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PSD and PDF formats.
 
To load your artwork, go to the Properties panel on the right side of the interface and click on the Load button next to each part of the shape that you want to decorate. For example, for the book cover, you can load an image for the front, back and spine.
 
After loading your artwork, you can adjust the settings such as size, position, rotation and skew in the Properties panel. You can also use the mouse or keyboard shortcuts to move and resize the artwork directly on the shape.
 
## Apply materials and effects
 
The third step is to apply materials and effects to make your mockup more realistic and attractive. You can use the Materials panel on the left side of the interface to choose from a variety of materials such as paper, plastic, metal, wood and more.

After applying a material, you can adjust its settings such as color, texture, reflection, transparency and more in the Properties panel.
 
You can also use the Effects panel on the left side of the interface to add some extra features such as shadows, reflections, depth of field and more. To enable an effect, simply check its box in the panel and adjust its settings in the Properties panel.
 
## Render and export your mockup
 
The final step is to render and export your mockup. Rendering is the process of generating a high-quality image of your scene with realistic lighting and shadows. Exporting is the process of saving your image as a file that you can use for your purposes.
 
To render your mockup, go to the Render menu at the top of the interface and choose Render or Render All Shapes. You can also use Ctrl+R or Cmd+R shortcuts.
 
A new window will open where you can choose some rendering options such as resolution, quality, format and output folder. You can also preview your image before rendering it by clicking on Preview button.
 
When you are ready, click on Start button to begin rendering. Depending on your settings and computer performance, this may take some time.
